# potd (Photo of the Day)

This is version 2 of my photo-of-the-day project, where I post one photo every day (gasp). Photos range from January 2024 to June 2024, then January 2025 to present.

I built this revision using SvelteKit.

## Developing

Install dependencies using `npm install`, then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
